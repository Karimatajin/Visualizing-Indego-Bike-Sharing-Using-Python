## Indego Bike Sharing

Project:

  The Animations are an interesting way of demonstrating a phenomenon. We as humans are always enthralled by animated and interactive charts rather than the static ones. This project was exploring the data found in Philadelphia's bike sharing website https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/ with the purpose to make an  animated visualization of the bike activity during 24 hours. The data was cleaned and manipulated using python libraries. Other command line used in this project is ffmpeg which is used to convert a set of images into a video.
