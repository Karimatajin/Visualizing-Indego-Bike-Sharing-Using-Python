## Visualizing-Indego-Bike-Sharing-Using-Python

This project was exploring the data found in Philadelphia's bike sharing service website https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/, I wanted to make an interesting visualization of the bike activity during 24 hours. The data was cleaned and manipulated using python libraries such as folium library for mapping. Other command line used in this project is ffmpeg which is used to convert a set of images into a video.
