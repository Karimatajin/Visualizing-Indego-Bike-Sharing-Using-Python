## Indego Bike Sharing

Project:

  Animations are an interesting way of demonstrating a phenomenon. We as humans are always enthralled by animated and interactive charts rather than the static ones, in this project I will  explore the data found in Philadelphia's bike sharing website https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/, the aim of this project is to make an interesting animated visualization of the bike activity during 24 hours. The data was cleaned and manipulated using python libraries. Other command line used in this project is ffmpeg which is used to convert a set of images into a video.
